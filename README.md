# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

> Student Project #1 during Advanced Front-End Development Nanodegree Program at Udacity.

The project consists on a game, in which you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. For detailed project instructions on how I got started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
